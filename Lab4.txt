Lab4: Classes (fields, methods, constructors, static, package)
===
  
If using Eclipse, begin this lab assignment as follows:
(1) Download the file lab4.zip from Blackboard.
(2) Create a new project called labs (not lab4!).
(3) In your project labs, create a package called lab4.
(4) Copy the files from lab4.zip into the lab4 folder.
  
When you have completed the assignment below, put
your completed Robot.java, RobotTest.java, and 
RobotPlay.java into a file lab4.zip and submit via 
Blackboard.

Complete the class Robot consistent with the specifications
in the comments for each method. Note that you will need to
declare new private fields in this class to hold the state 
of each Robot constructed. (Initialize those fields in the
constructor.) Read the method specifications carefully!
  
---
Complete the program RobotTest so that it constructs
a Robot and then calls each of the methods available 
in the Robot class at least once. In your test program, 
have your robot end where it begins, so that the distance 
from begin to end locations should be zero. Is it zero? 
If not, why not? Complete and use the method print so 
that you can easily track the state of your robot.

Use the class RobotPlay to play with a Robot. As written,
this class RobotPlay is marginally useful; improve it as
follows:
  
a) Draw the robot better so that its heading is obvious.
  
b) When the robot battery is drained, draw the robot in 
red. When battery power is full to capacity, draw the 
robot in blue.
  
c) Draw text on the playing field to display the current 
battery power, current (x,y) coordinates, and current 
distance of the robot from the point where it was first 
constructed.
